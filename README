Program Goals

1. Load one or more files, and plot on same (or different?) graphs
2. If loading multiple graphs, shift selected graph in time
3. Offset selected graph (shift baseline)
4. Average selected graphs
5. Stack graphs
6. Filter individual graphs, or stacked graph

What is the simplest way to accomplish the above?  Some kind of command-line tool with a pipeline structure
would be prudent.
